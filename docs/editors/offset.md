FNF: Doido Engine has it's own Character Editor, that can configure all the offsets of your characters! Though it might seem intimidating at first, it's very simple to use!

## Configuring the Editor

The `Characters` tab can be used to configure many things about the editor, the character and the ghost. Here is a list of what you can change.
- The `Character` and `Ghost` dropdowns (!) are used to select which character you are editing or which ghost you are seeing.
- The `Char FlipX` and `Ghost FlipX` checkboxes let you flip the character or ghost horizontally.
- The `Playable` checkbox lets you select if the character you are editing is Playable or not. If you don't use this correctly your offsets might be wrong in-game. (NOTE: This does not affect the Ghost, so you need to set `Ghost FlipX` separatly)
- The `Show Ghost` checkbox lets you enable or disable the ghost.
- The `Focus on Character` checkbox decides if the camera is currently focusing on the character or not.
- The `Currently Editing` section decides which offset you are currently editing. You can also use the text fields to manually set an offset.

In any of the next sections, please make sure you select the correct offset before editing.

## Editing Offsets

On the upper left corner of the screen, you will find the Animation selector. Simply click on any of the animations on the left to select the character's anim, and on the right to select the ghost's anim. After that, you can use the `ARROW KEYS` to change the offset and hold the `SHIFT KEYS` to increase them by 10.
