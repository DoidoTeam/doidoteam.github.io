This enables many debug features, such as the FlxDebugger and debugging through VSCode.","-DFREEPLAY and -DMENU launch the game directly in the Freeplay and MainMenu states, respectively. These can't be used together."]}],[{"i":"#","p":["FNF: Doido Engine Documentation"]},{"l":"Source Folder","p":["Our Source folder is organized according to what function each .hx file has:","data/ holds important code relating to the engine's core functions and tools, such as Highscore, Timings, Discord and the CrashHandler. You will probably only use this to add Songs or change the Discord Status config.","flixel/ has modified HaxeFlixel code that is optimized for Doido Engine. You probably won't need to use this.","gameObjects/ is where all the objects are stored, such as Characters, Stages, Notes and all the UI. This is something you will use a lot. It has a couple of subfolders specific to the HUD or menus.","shaders/ is where any graphical shaders are stored. Included in the engine is DistantNoteShader, but you might wanna add more, depending on your mod's needs.","states/ and substates/ hold the code for the game's states, such as the PlayState or MainMenuState for states/, and the GameOverSubState or PauseSubState for substates/."]}],[{"i":"#","p":["FNF: Doido Engine Documentation"]},{"l":"Custom Characters"},{"l":"Adding your assets","p":["Firstly, place your character in their own folder in assets/images/characters/. You aren't required to make a new folder but it helps organizing so we recommend you do so!","After that, place their icon in assets/images/icons/ with the name icon-YOUR_CHARACTER_NAME.","Every character has a json file that holds their animation offsets, aswell as global, camera and rating positions. These are named after the character (Ex. bf.json) and are located in assets/images/_offsets/. These are made with the engine's Character Editor."]},{"l":"Coding your characters","p":["Code for the characters is handled by Character.hx, which is situated in the gameObjects Source folder. For more info on how the Source folder is structured, click here."]},{"l":"Basic code","p":["To add your new character, you need to add a new case to the switch statement around line 54. Here's the basis on how it works. Feel free to copy this into your code and edit it accordingly."]},{"l":"Animations","p":["The anims array works under this format. You can use this as a reference to add custom animations.","ANIMATION_NAME is what you want to name your animation inside the game","ANIMATION_PREFIX is what your animation is called in it's .xml spritesheet","FRAMERATE is what framerate the animation is gonna play at (we recommend you use 24)","LOOPED decides if the animation should loop when it reaches the end (for singing or other mid-song animations, set this to false)","[FRAMES] is an array of which frames of the animation should be played. Normally you can leave this out but this is useful for GF/speaker type characters."]},{"l":"Other variables","p":["Your character might need other variables to make it work right.","The scale of a character can be changed with scale.set(width,height);","Like other engines, if your character is facing the left (Like BF or Pico), you should set flipX to true.","idleAnims allows you to change which idle animation(s) the character uses. For example, Skid and Pump use [danceLeft, danceRight] to give them their dance. If you have more than one idle anim, you should set quickDancer to true.","antialiasing allows you to disable smoothing on the character, giving them a more \"jagged\" look.","isPixelSprite is used to determine if a character is Pixel Art or not. Use this for characters like Senpai or BF-Pixel","deathChar allows you to set a separate character as a death sprite."]},{"l":"Adding your character to the charList","p":["After coding your character, you still need to add it to the engine's internal list. Simply go over to CoolUtil.hx, and add your character's name to the charList() function."]},{"l":"Editing Offsets","p":["The final step to making a character is to edit their offsets using our custom Character Editor.","Custom Characters"]}],[{"i":"#","p":["FNF: Doido Engine Documentation"]},{"l":"Custom Stages"},{"l":"Adding your assets","p":["Assets for stages are usually placed in assets/images/backgrounds/, though you are free to place them wherever you want.

You can create an array of stages to be preloaded with the song that can later be changed between without any lag.

Here is a list of what you can change.","The Character and Ghost dropdowns (!) are used to select which character you are editing or which ghost you are seeing.","The Char FlipX and Ghost FlipX checkboxes let you flip the character or ghost horizontally.","The Playable checkbox lets you select if the character you are editing is Playable or not. If you don't use this correctly your offsets might be wrong in-game. (NOTE: This does not affect the ghost, so you need to set Ghost FlipX separatly)","The Show Ghost checkbox lets you enable or disable the ghost.","The Focus on Character checkbox decides if the camera is currently focusing on the character or not.","The Currently Editing section decides which offset you are currently editing. You can also use the text fields to manually set an offset.","The Save button lets you save your character's JSON file. See Saving your Character section for info"]},{"l":"Controls","p":["Arrow Keys move the selected animation's offset","Holding Shift will increment them by 10","Holding Ctrl will increment them by 100","Middle mouse button will move the camera WITHOUT changing its offset (Check Focus on Character to return it to the offset position)","Scroll Wheel will change the zoom of the camera"]},{"l":"Ghost","p":["Under your character, there exists a slightly transparent version of them called a Ghost. This is meant as a reference for animation offsets, and you can select its animation or even swap them for a completely different character."]},{"l":"Editing Offsets","p":["In any of the next sections, please make sure you select the correct offset before editing."]},{"l":"Animation Offsets","p":["On the upper left corner of the screen, you will find the Animation selector. Simply click on any of the animations on the left to select the character's anim, and on the right to select the ghost's anim."]},{"l":"Global Offsets","p":["Global offset is the overall position of the character in the stage. To help with this we recommend you align the global position with the red cross that's under the character. This way you can do character changes without having to worry about positions being buggy and they will automatically align to any stage you put them in!"]},{"l":"Rating Offsets","p":["Rating offset is the position of the rating sprite when you hit a note as them. This is only able to be seen when you disable the Ratings on HUD option."]},{"l":"Camera Offsets","p":["Camera offset is where the camera is gonna be when your character is focused on in-game. It may be a little hard to set it up from the editor so you can also manually edit the JSON and restart the song from the pause menu to reload."]},{"l":"Saving your Character","p":["After you finish your character, you can press the Save button to export a JSON file, which you should save to assets/images/characters/_offsets/"]}],[{"i":"#","p":["FNF: Doido Engine Documentation"]},{"l":"Showcase","p":["You may be wondering, \"What kind of mods can i do with this engine?\".
